    <h1>8 Dimensions of Wellness</h1>
    <div><p>Wellness is more than health.  It is living fully.  We believe wellness is conscious and inclusive, self-directed and evolving, holistic and multidimensional, positive and affirming.</p></div>
    <div><p>Wellness is fueling your body, engaging your mind, and nurturing your spirit.  How we think about wellness is affected by our culture and our life experiences.</p></div>
    <div><p>While all dimensions of wellness need our attention for us to truly flourish, there doesn’t have to be a balance among all dimensions.  Instead, the goal is to find a personal harmony with the dimensions that are most authentic for you.  You can’t get there passively, it requires active awareness, acceptance, and commitment through choices you make every day no matter how small.</p></div>
